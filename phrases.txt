born so small in that nurturing pod of warmth
growing out from a single point
into endless possibilities

great ancient leviathans
masses of life that connect across the vast expanse of sea

we bloom and breathe in the balance

the world above is a shining dream
it roars and shakes
it sheds its dead
they may have forgotten our worlds are linked
but we still remember our song

--------------------------------------

created very big into A toxic box of cold
shrinking in from a larger sphere
facing limited options

lame new mollusks
only a few lives disperse around A little pond

I wilt and gasp with instability

A pebble bellow is a dull sleep
it squeaks and beeps
it molts its alive
you seem to remember your house is floating
but you just forget my poem
