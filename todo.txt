TO DO

- assign Elise's instruments for all puzzles! (I thought I did this)
- Finale

- Add (?) help button and screen
- play new VO
- copy the present words into the "firstwords"

- check for each puzzle:
	- width height and x positioning of each row
	- size of each word
	- colliders
	- punctuation

- remove repeat notes in puzzle 2
- puzzle 4 too slow
- remove "it", just "sheds its dead", 
- add comma after shakes,

- gaps between in and out breath
- the effects are leaving little pixels on the corner
- fish schools look pretty tightly horizontally packed (lines)

- camera angle / words placement more evenly around sub

- uneven sizes on words on puzzle 1
- space out puzzle 1 rows more vertically?
- space puzzle 3 words together more closely horizontally
- make puzzle 2 words larger where possible?

- transition in new puzzle word groups
- add cave (- adjust left edge, add something behind it, duplicate cave on the right for exiting, double cave for looping inside.

- exclamation on leviathans!

- slow gradually down when the new words hit on initpuzzle

- snappier transitions

- parallel rows should count as single rows for colouring

BUG:
- where did FROM go at the end?
