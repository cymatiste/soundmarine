TO DO

- Finale

- little whale progress icons?
- clickable fish?
- LOTS OF BUBBLES ON EXIT CAVE
- add a whale pod chilling in the background during finale

BUBBLES TO HIDE QUICK JUMP CUT TO EXIT CAVE

- Add (?) help button and screen
- play new VO
- copy the present words into the "firstwords"

- check for each puzzle:
	- width height and x positioning of each row
	- size of each word
	- colliders (too wide on puzzle 5)
	- punctuation
	- instrument assignments?
	- timing of notes

- remove repeat notes in puzzle 2
- add comma after shakes,

- can't pick up IT 

- gaps between in and out breath
- the effects are leaving little pixels on the corner

- camera angle / words placement more evenly around sub

- transition in new puzzle word groups
- add cave (- adjust left edge, add something behind it, duplicate cave on the right for exiting, double cave for looping inside.

- exclamation on leviathans!

- slow gradually down when the new words hit on initpuzzle

- snappier transitions

BUG:
- VERY HARD to pick up small words near the end ...???
